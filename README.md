# Advanced-Audio-Player
HTML Based Audio Player with multiple AB Repeat points and customized loop numbers.

Disclaimer- You dont have to credit me if you make something out of it but do make something out of it if possible. Code is solely given by ChatGPT so all credit goes to it. Spread the code as someone might make a futuristic media player out of it.

I am just an useless guy who blabbers a lot! ( I really mean it. Dont freaking waste your time btw as time is precious)

Features of this media player - 
1.You can set multiple A-B repeat points and they will follow the order of playback like as A1-B1->A2-B2->A3-B3->.......->An-Bn.

2.You can set the next repeat point for a previous time period also (For example in a song which has 50 min of playback time, you can set A2-B2 Repeat Point on 5min to 7min even if A1-B1 Repeat point has been set on 15min to 20min) 

3.You can set a custom loop number for which the song will be looped accordingly. ( For example if you set loop as 5 then it will be looped for 5 times only.) (Btw loop wont work if An-Bn repeat points have been setup)



Have a nice blast ahead mate. I wish you all the best.
